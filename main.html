	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time Complexity referes to the efficient of an algorithm
		in terms of the time it takes to execute. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Space Complexity , on the other hand , focuses on the amount 
		of storage an algorithm uses during its executions.
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in designing algorithm.
		it is often measure in terms of "Big O" notation, which describes how the 
		space requirements of an algorithm scale with the inpiyt size.
